Transformation of SVG elements involve translate, scale, rotate and skew operations.
Translation operation requires 2 parameters that define how the svg element has to be translated along the x axis and y axis.
Scale operation requires 2 parameters like translation, defines what is the scaling factor along x and y axis.
Rotate operation requires rotation angle, center of rotation in x and y axis.
Skewx and skewy take a single parameter that defines skew angle along x and y axis respectively.
'g' tag is used to define a svg group of elements.
Can apply any of the above transformations to group of elements as well.
Transformation can be applied sequentially too just by separating them by whitespace.

These functions and attributes can be called in d3 as well although there exists a library that can be referenced too 
which is called d3-transform.js, when this is included in the script src tag, we can directly call transofrm, rotate and other functions.
