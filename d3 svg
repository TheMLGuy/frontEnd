SVG stands for scalable vector graphics.
SVG is an XML based graphic rendering tenchnique.Can draw line, circle, ellipse, rectangle and so on.
It has a tag called <svg> with which we get to define attributes like height, width and so on and some properties that are relevant to a
geometric construct. SVG elements can be included in html and their locations are relative to the origin(0,0).
For a line:
  First define an svg canvas/image where line will be drawn
  Second use the relevant tag name for the image to be rendered
  <svg width="300" height="300">
  
    <line x1="100" x2="100" y1="200" y2="200" style="stroke:rgb(255,0,0); stroke-width:2"></line>
  
  </svg>
  This means in a svg image 300x300, a line from coordinates (100,100) to (200,200) is drawn with width 2 and whose color is (255,0,0)
  
  The above code can be used in d3 in a much more simpler dot notation
    Just create a div for storing the svg attribute, then use d3 to 'append' svg and add attributes using 'attr', finally 
    store the svg into a var and then to create a line tag, just append line too svg variable and go on creating required attributes.
