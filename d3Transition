Transition is used to cause a change in state for an element.
It does not support data and append methods, but supports most of the selectors.
Has its own functions like ease, duration and so on.
Any append or data methods have to be called before transition.

For instance, if <body>'s color has to be changed upon loading but not immediately can specify a duration(x) xms and the color will change
as per the style attribute mentioned.
