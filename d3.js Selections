Selections are used to operate on selected elements on a web page.
Can access an element by using select() or selectAll(), once selected can modify, append or remove elements.
select()-> selects the first element that matches the query
selectAll->selects all elements that match the query 

An example:
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="Javascript" src="cdn url"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="mydiv">
    </div>
   <script>d3.select("mydiv")</script>
  </body>
 This will select mydiv div element and will perform an operation like modify/add/remove and so on.
 D3 functions use dot notations and chain syntaxm so its easy to keep adding functions as long as they are relevant to the object.
 Can add content to an existing dom element by using append. 
Ways to select id is using #, to select class name is using ".classname", to select any other element's tag "tagname"
append creates new content ex: d3.select("mydiv").append("span") this just appends span open n close tag
To add text, after append, call text("text added"), then span tag has text element attached to it.
attribute works on a property of that element ex: attr("style", "color:green") changes style attribute color to green
style works on the css properties only ex: style("color":'green')
