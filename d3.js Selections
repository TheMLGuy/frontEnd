Selections are used to operate on selected elements on a web page.
Can access an element by using select() or selectAll(), once selected can modify, append or remove elements.
select()-> selects the first element that matches the query
selectAll->selects all elements that match the query 

An example:
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="Javascript" src="cdn url"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="mydiv">
    </div>
   <script>d3.select("mydiv")</script>
  </body>
 This will select mydiv div element and will perform an operation like modify/add/remove and so on.
 D3 functions use dot notations and chain syntaxm so its easy to keep adding functions as long as they are relevant to the object.
 Can add content to an existing dom element by using append.
