Duration vs delay
Duration helps us to specify how smoothly should the transition happen, suppose duration(5000) is specified, then the 
transition will kick in for the whole duration of 5sec. It will be smooth.
Delay is to make the transition appear after a certain time mentioned, that is delay(5000) means after 5secs the transition will just appear.
4 life phases of transition:
schedule, start transition, running the transition and end the transition
